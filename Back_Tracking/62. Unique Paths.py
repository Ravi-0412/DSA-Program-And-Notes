# Method 1: 

# correct only but will give TLE
# just reverse the problem i.e you have to reach (0,0) from (m-1,n-1) that's why u can take go left or up
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:

# Method 2:
# memoization
# time: O(n^2)

# Method 3: 
# tabulation:
# Bottom up (0,0) to (m-1,n-1). but for filling with base case you have to think opposite i.e from (m-1,n-1) to (0,0)
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:

                dp[i][j]= dp[i][j-1] + dp[i-1][j]

# Method 4: 
# concise way of writing the above one

                dp[i][j]= dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
        return dp[m-1][n-1]


# Method 5: 
# tabulation: top down
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        dp= [[0 for j in range(n)] for i in range(m)]
        # initialise with base cases, last row and last col with 1

                if i== m-1 or j== n-1:
                    dp[i][j]= 1
        for i in range(m-2, -1, -1):
            for j in range(n-2, -1, -1):
                dp[i][j]= dp[i+1][j] + dp[i][j+1]
