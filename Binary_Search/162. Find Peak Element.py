# Method 2: Better one
# same logic with Template 2

"""
# Note: This same logic can  be used to find one of the peak ele(ele greater than neighbours) in any type of array.
# this doesn't mean you can find the max in any array using this approach. 
# only mean you can find any one of those ele following the property or array following this type of property.
    
# e.g:1)  '852. Peak Index in a Mountain Array'
# in this there will be only one peak ele
# other things are totally same as '162. find peak index'. 

# 2) 1095. Find in Mountain Array
