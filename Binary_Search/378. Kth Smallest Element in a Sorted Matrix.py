# VVI (very good approach)
# modifying heap and using the sorted rows and columns benefit.
# logic: Since each of the rows in matrix are already sorted, we can understand the problem as 
# "finding the kth smallest element from amongst M sorted rows."
    
# We start the pointers to point to the beginning of each rows as all next smaller ele will be connected to this pointer only.
#  then we iterate k times to find the ans.
# for each time ith, the top of the minHeap is the ith smallest element in the matrix. 
# We pop the top from the minHeap then add the next element which has the same row & next col with the poped one
# as this ele can be next minimum.

# Time: O(k* log(min(k, m)) + O(k*logk))
# Space: O(K)

# method 3: 
# using binary search (more optimised)
# time: O((m + n) *log(A)), A= difference between minimum value and maximum value in the matrix.
# logic explanation: 
# We have a way to count how many numbers are less than or equal to x in the table 
# (let's call this function count(x)). We can simply apply binary search over the range [matrix[0][0], matrix[-1][-1]] 
# and iteratively check if mid has atleast k numbers less than or equal to mid.

# 1) If count(mid) < k, there are less than k numbers which are less than or equal to mid in the table. 
# So mid or any integer left than it can't be our answer. We have to increase our mid and for this we will incr 'left' i.e left = mid+1.
# 2) If count(mid) >= k, there are atleast k numbers (maybe more) which are less than or equal to mid in the table. 
# So, mid is a possible valid solution. But there can be a smaller number than mid as well which has count(.) >= k. 
# So, we mark current mid as possible answer ans and check for lower range as well by doing right = mid

# template 2 only.
