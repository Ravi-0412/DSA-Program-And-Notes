# Basic: 

# Observation: a)  when we will put all elements in an 1d array row wise then they will in increasing order only.
# b) It will be also sorted row wise and column wise.

# Both 'a' and 'b' conclusion is valid because of  two things given in Q : 
# 1) Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order. 
# 2) The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

# Method 1:
# Note vvi: Using the observation 'when we will put all elements in an 1d array row wise then they will in increasing order only'

# so we can first find in which row element lies by comparing the 1st and last ele of that row.
# and then we can apply the binary search on that row.

# Also Here we can find the exact row of any element. 
# But in Q :'240. Search a 2D Matrix II' we can't .

# time: O(m+ log*n)

                low= mid+1
        return True if arr[low]== key else False


# method 2: 
# little more optimised
# instead of searching in which row target lies linearly, we can use binary search.
# Note vvi: Whenever you have to compare target with two values like here 
# then better use 1st template for avoid confusion.
    
# time: O(log*m + log*n)= O(log (m*n))

# Method 3: 
# Using the observation row wise and column wise will be sorted also.
# Note: whenever you find row wise and column wise sorted apply this logic.

# it's is pretty nicee and easy method , it's approach is soo nicee.
# logic: just start checking from top right corner and
# if not found then update the value of iterating variable properly
# where we can get the element just like binary search.

# why we are not checking from (0,0)?
# Reason: in case matrix ele is smaller then we won't be able to move in untraversed matrix i.e 
# either right or down because both 'left' and 'right' will have greater ele only.
# i.e no choice for smaller case and two choice for greater case.

# But when we traverse from top right then in unequal case we will have only one choice for each smaller and greater case.
# left will have smaller ele then cur one and down will have greater ele than cur one.
# if target is smaller choices: left , if greater choices: down

# Time: O(m+n)

# Note Q: "240. Search a 2D Matrix II" is exactly same as this method only because :matrix is sorted row wise and column wise 

# Note vvi: 1) When sorted in ascending order row wise and column wise then ,
# Start traverse from top - right.
# e.g : i ) 74. Search a 2D Matrix   ii) 240. Search a 2D Matrix II
# iii) 378. Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix iv ) 668. Kth Smallest Number in Multiplication Table
    
# 2) When sorted in descending order row wise and column wise then ,
# Start traverse from bottom - left.
# e.g : i) 1351. Count Negative Numbers in a Sorted Matrix
    
# you can do other way also but this way will be easier.

# Method 4: 
# Using binary search directly
# How we can we think of this ?
# Ans: Using the observation 'when we will put all elements in an 1d array row wise then they will in increasing order only'.
# so we can treat this maxtrix as just 1D sorted array when we will traverse row wise.
# Other valid way to calulcate (r, c):
# 1) r = mid //col  , c = mid - r*col

# My mistake:
# r = mid //row ,  c = mid % col
