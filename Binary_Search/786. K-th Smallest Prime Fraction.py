# Method 2: 

# Note: Inserting both (i, j- 1) and (i+ 1, j) will give ans because (i + 1, j) may already in heap before
# when we are adding 1st and last i.e (i , j - 1)
# e.g: say n = 5 . in heap = [(0, 4) , (1, 4) ....]
# suppose 1st (0, 4) i.e i = 0, j = 4 get poped and if we insert (i + 1, j) i.e (1, 4) then this will be duplication.

# So insert only (i , j- 1).
    

# Or take a visited set and insert both pair if not already visited.

# Method 3: 
# using binary search.
# used the similar concept of "719. Find K-th Smallest Pair Distance".
# logic: first find the range in which our fraction can lie. 
# for possible fraction calculate the no of pair smaller than that and keep storing the largest fraction pair smaller than mid. 
# And if count of any 'mid' value== k: return that pair .
    
# vvi: Here we need to return simply when we will find the ans.So in while loop we will use 'start<=end'.
# note: while updating start and end , here we will make both equal to mid only because we are deaing in fraction and 
# max possible value is '1' only so we can't update start like 'mid+1' and end like 'mid -1'.

# time: O(NlogW), where N is array size, and W is the range size between the smallest and the largest fraction, in float number space.
