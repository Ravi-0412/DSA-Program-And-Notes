# method 1: 

# just same as "Allocate minimum pages". in this we have to find the maximum instead of 'minimum' that's it.
# here we are checking for valid position for placing cow then updating the 'lastcowPOSITION',
# as here we have to palce when we will find any position.

# time: O(nlogn)
# just like we find the last index of an element in sorted array.
