# method 1:

Time: O(n *log(sum(arr)- max(arr)))
the best thing about this q is binary search is applicable even array is unsorted

you can reduce this problem into: Divide the given array into 'm' subarrays such that 
1)'max sum of the splitted subarrays should be minimum' OR 2) 'sum of absolute diff of any two divided subarrays should be minimum'.

how binary search?: just like we did in '378. k smallest element'. 
we can find mid and check it is valid to allocate this much max no of pages acc to the mid if valid then we will find the next smaller
else we will search for pages greater than mid.


logic: # since every student should allocated at least one book so we can start checking
between max(A) and sum(A) for min greatest , no need from  0 to sum(A).
start= max(A) , since we have to give atleast one book to each stident.
end= sum(A), there is only one student.

mid is denoting the max no of pages a student can be allocated.
if it is valid to allocate pages for the given mid(max_page) then 
we will search for another minimum in left side of mid
and will store that mid as temporary ans in the 'res'.   
else we will search for greater minimum on right side of the mid
at last we will return the res

note: Actually we are checking 'after allocating maximum of no pages as 'mid' to a student , Are we able to divide among all students?'.
If yes then we will decrease the 'mid' and if no then we will increase the mid.
in this we are minmising the maximum pages allocated to a student.

            # in this case we will increase the no of student and start allocating the books to the new student.

            # here you can update the ans to find the allocated the pages allocated to different student. we do this later

                sum= A[i]

# Extension: 

# vvi Note: This type of logic is applied in Q asking minimise the max i.e min(max of all possible ans or distribution etc.) OR
# maximise the minimum i.e max(min of all possible ans) given some number 'k' or 'm' or both.
# And when we have to make distribution/parts for consecutive ele (applied in non-consecutive also sometime).

# for end value(in General): jisme hmko divide karna h usko minimse kar do and jisko hmko divide karna h usko maximise kar do.(Q ke anusar)
# just logically socho ki mera value kahan se kahan tak lie kar sakta h(corner case leke) according to the Q.
