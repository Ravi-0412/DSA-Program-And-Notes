# Method 1: 

# since we dont know the size so using binary search after finding length is not a good approach.
# but if we can find that target ele exist bw any two index
# then we can apply binary search bw those index.
# so,now problem reduces to find the range in which the target ele exist
# for finding the range we can move in chunk like first size of 2
# then 4, then 8 ....

    i= 0
    while arr[2**(i+1)] < target: # means target not lie in this range
                             # so now incr the range in pow of tw
        i+= 1
    # when while loop will fail means we have found the range
    # so now apply binary search in this range to find the position
    position= BinarySearch(arr, target, 2**i -1, 2**(i+1))   # start= 2**i -1 to handle the case when ele is present at zero index.
    return position
