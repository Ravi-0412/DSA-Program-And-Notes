Say you have four stones a,b,c,d.
first you smash b against c, you get (b-c)
now you smash (b-c) against a
you get a-(b-c) which is same as (a+c)-(b)
now you smash d against (a+c)-b
you get d-((a+c)-b) which is same as (d+b)-(a+c).
Basically for the given stones we can create two sets,the sum of second set of stones to be subtracted from sum of first one.
ideally we want sum of each set to be sum(stones)/2 so that they cancel each other out.

So to solve the problem we try to 'select a set of stones such that their sum comes as close as possible to sum(stones)/2'.
Clearly this subproblem is analogous to the knapsack problem.

# How to do this?
# we can reduce this further more to ' partition an array into 2 subsets whose difference is minima.
# And we have to find that difference.

# How to find the diff?
# (1) S1 + S2  = S
# (2) S1 - S2 = diff  , s1 >= s2
# ==> solving these two: take s1 = s - s2 from (1) and put in 2nd then 
# diff = S - 2 * S2 
# ==> minimize diff equals to  maximize S2 

# Finally reduces to find: 'Minium sum Partition'.

# So question reduces to find closest sum (sum of numbers) to (SUM/2).
# for finding closest sum to sum(arr)/2. we can do like.
