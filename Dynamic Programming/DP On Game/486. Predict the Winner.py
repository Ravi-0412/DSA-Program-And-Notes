q: if there is atleast one possible way in which player1 can score more then player1 will win.

logic: we have to maximise the score of player1.
so if player1 1) choose first ele('i') then next time he can choose  'i+2' or 'j' 
if player2 choose 'i+1' and 'i+1' or 'j-1' if player2 choose 'j'.
and 2) choose last ele('j') then next time he can choose 'i' or 'j-1' if player 2 choose 'j-1' and 'i+1' or 'j-1' if player2 choose 'i'.

vvi: since 2nd player will maximise his score in every move then 1st player will get min of two cases after player2 choose.
and finally player1 will maximise his score so he will take max of all the cases.


How to approach?
Ans: just find the max number of score player1 can make when both player plays optimally.
At last compare this score with score of player2. score of player2= sum(nums)- player1_score.

logic to find the max score of player1:

currently 1st with choosable i, j,
        1.if 1st picks nums[i], 2nd can pick either ends of nums[i + 1, j]
            a.if 2nd picks nums[i + 1], 1st can pick either ends of nums[i + 2, j]
            b.if 2nd picks nums[j], 1st can pick either ends of nums[i + 1, j - 1]
            since 2nd plays to maximize his score, 1st can get nums[i] + min(1.a, 1.b)
						
        2.if 1st picks nums[j], 2nd can pick either ends of nums[i, j - 1]
            a.if 2nd picks nums[i], 1st can pick either ends of nums[i + 1, j - 1];
            b.if 2nd picks nums[j - 1], 1st can pick either ends of nums[i, j - 2];
            since 2nd plays to maximize his score, 1st can get nums[j] + min(2.a, 2.b)
        
        since the 1st plays to maximize his score overall, 1st can get max(nums[i] + min(1.a, 1.b), nums[j] + min(2.a, 2.b))
