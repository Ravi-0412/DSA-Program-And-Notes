# Method 1;

logic: 

The first approach that comes to our mind is the greedy approach. Now see the below example and try to understand that how it doesnâ€™t give the correct solution.
example : DAY 1 :  10 30 20
          DAY 2 :  10 100 20

          Greedily, we'll pick 30 from day 1 (MAX) and 20 (Second MAX after 100) from day 2 as 100 cannot be picked due same activity cannot take place in two consecutive days
          so we end up the total as (30 + 20) = 50 points

          But clearly we can see, the actual answer should be (20 from day1 + 100 from day2) = 120 points

          so greedy fails!!

          Now we try out all possible options and Recursion will be the one which generates all possible options.

          what two things we need to consider here is 
          i) the current day as day ranges from 0 to n-1
          ii) the last chosen activity what we chose for day-1 or day+1 (it depends on how we consider the recursion call (0 to n-1) or (n-1 to 0) )

          f(currDay, lastAct) --> The maximum points till currDay with lastAct acitivity on pervious day
          Base case :  considering recursion call (n-1 to 0):
                     when we reach at day = 0 we calculate the max points and return it

                     considering recursion call (0 to n-1);
                     when we reach at day = n-1 we calcuate the max points and return it.
