# Method 1:
# Recursion
# Approach: Front partitioning
# logic: you can only partition at any index if string till that index is palindrome.
# in this we only need to pass one parameter, for checking palindrome at each index.

# method 2: 
# Memoization(Accepted)
# for time complexity: see the no of variable changing(say m) and no of 'for' loop (say p)
# time= O(n*r1*r2*....).  r1, r2,....: are size of variable changing in function as well as inside the for loop.

# here : time: O(n^2) as both the variable changing in function as well as variable inside the for loop is O(n)
