If we closely observe the problem then we can convert this problem to longest Common Subsequence Problem.
Firstly we will create another array of unique elements of original array and sort it. 
Now the longest increasing subsequence of our array must be present as a subsequence in our sorted array. 
Thatâ€™s why our problem is now reduced to finding the common subsequence between the two arrays.

# Better one
"""
Note vvvi: This is better one template in case of 'take' and 'notTake'  which there is 'notTake' option always there.
So just find the condition for 'take' and return the max(take, notTake)

How?
There is no need to check the possibility of 'taking' and 'not taking' in possible case.
There is always one choice to 'not take' and we can only take if follows the sequence.

in case of pick and non_pick always write the pick case and non_pick case separately 
if there are some condition involved before including or not_including any ele.

And 'pre_ind' will go from 'n-1' to '-1' but it can't be equal to ind , it will be always less than the 'ind'..So it will from 'ind-1' to '-1'.

best one: using binary search to find the proper position of curr index in case not follows the pattern 
and removing the curr ele at that index in 'subsequence'.

How Binary search?
Since LIS will be in strictly sorted order only.
if cur ele follows the sequence i.e > pre added one then, we will add this directly i.e
If 'num' is bigger than last ele of sub, we just extend our list 
Otherwise, we will simply apply binary search to find the smallest element >= num and replace it.

why this logic is giving correct ans?
Ans: Replace karenge tb length to wahi rhega but smaller ele se replace karne pe next ele ka append hone ka chance increase kar jayega.
kyonki chota se replace kar rhe. e.g: [2, 8] next ele is '3'. 
after replacing => [2,3] ab agar next elements '3' se large hua to append kar denge directly,
 but agar [2,8] hota tb sirf '8' se bda wale ko hi append kar pate. 
Append kitna jayda ho rha last me wahi mera length ko increase karega..

Note: if we will use 'bisect_right' then we get duplicates also if 'num' is already  in 'sub' so using 'bisect_left'
 since we need to replace with smallest ele in sub >= num.
If we use 'bisect_right' then, it will replace with next greater ele than 'num', so we may get duplicate like pre and num will be same only.

Note vvi: 'sub' will give one of the 'LIS' .
