case 3: if both insertion and deletion is allowed then total no of  operation will equal to 1st case only i.e if only deletion will be allowed

now make the string 1 equal to string 2 by adding the extra char of string 2 other than lcs

"""
Note: Indirectly making both equal to lcs only. But did after a long time so forgot about lcs and came with method.
Logic : 1) when 1st char of both will be same then ans= f(s1[1: ] , s2[1 :]) as there is no need to delete any char in this case.
2) if 1st char of both is not equal then we have two choices i.e a) delete 1st char in 's1' or b ) delete 1st char in 's2'.
why not deleting both because later char can become same like 'LCS' so minimum we will get in this case only.

Base case: when any of string becomes empty then in this case only way to make them equal is to make both empty.
 we have to delete the length of other string to make both of them equal 

Logic is similar to 'lcs' but opposite.
