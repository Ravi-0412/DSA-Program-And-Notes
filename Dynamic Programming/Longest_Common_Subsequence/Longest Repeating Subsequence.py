# Method 1: 
"""
take the same string and find the longest common subsequence
only thing to change when both char are equal at same index
in that case we have to exclude that count,
otherwise this char will be counted in both the subsequences.
but we have to count repeating char only 
 and take max of other two like we used to case of unequal one.

vvi: we only have to check whether the curr char is present somewhere also in the string for repeating and for this 
only thing you have to keep in mind that when both char are equal then must not be at the same index that's it. 
 This is the only difference from lcs
this will mean that same char is present at somewhere also means it is repeating
