# method 1: using DFS+ hashmap
# logic:

To clone a graph:
Stepwise
1. We must create a new copy of every node and all its neighbors.
2. Graphs can have cycles or shared neighbors, so we need to avoid cloning the same node more than once.
3. To handle this, we use a hashmap:
   - It keeps track of already cloned nodes.
   - It prevents re-cloning and avoids infinite loops.
# and for traversal, we have to use either BFS or DFS

We use Depth-First Search (DFS) to go through the graph:
- If a node hasn’t been cloned:
  - Clone it and store it in the hashmap.
  - Recursively clone all of its neighbors.
- If it’s already cloned, just return it from the hashmap.
