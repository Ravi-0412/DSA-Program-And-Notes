"""
Logic: 
You have 4 wheels, each can move forward or backward (clockwise or anticlockwise).From one lock state, you can reach 8 new states (4 wheels Ã— 2 directions).
We use BFS to explore these states level by level until we reach the target.

There are 10,000 possible states (0000 to 9999), so BFS is efficient here. This is like a multi-source BFS where each state leads to neighbors.

Time complexity

Time: 10**4 * 8
Because for each 4 wheel , we will have 10 choices (0 to 9) and for for each 10**4 state there 
will be 8 neighbours. (4 wheels can rotate either in clockwise or anticlockwise s0 4*2 = 8).
