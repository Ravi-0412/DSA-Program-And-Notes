# Method 1: 

"""
logic: negative no is making problem like if product till now is min but next time it can become the ans if next ele will be negative.
that's why maintaining two varaibel to store the curr_max and curr_min till now.
here we are becoming greedy as we can get our ans from both like curr_min and curr_max.
