# Method 1: 

"""
Note: the goal of this problem is to "find a num that makes the sum of moves is minimum".

Just used the logic: learnt from the Q :"2448. Minimum Cost to Make Array Equal".

the elements are to be made equal to any of the three measures of central tendency mean / median / mode.
But which of this should be taken that is the main question we need to figure out?

Note vvvvi: 1) If the cost for all element is the same, then the minimum cost is when all numbers converge at the median.
2) If the cost is not the same, we need to find a weighted median.

How to find median?
1) sort the array
median = mean of the middle values in case of even 'n' and the middle value itself in case of 'n' is odd.

Why not mean?
Example(if we take mean): [1, 97, 98, 99, 100]. In this case, the avg(mean) is 50. 
However, in this case only one element is to the left of 50 while 4 on its right. 
In this case, wouldn't it better for the first element to increment and go near the other elements rather than decrement 4 elements.

Note vvi: when ever you want to equalize values in an array and the absolute value change in each item
to make it equal we should consider the median value as the final value.
