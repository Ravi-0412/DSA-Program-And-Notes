How to think this?
Ans: After chooisng 'k' cards whatever way we choose, we will be left with a continous subarray of size= 'n -k' cards.
Because you can’t choose 2nd element from the beginning unless 
you have chosen the first one. Similarly, you can’t choose 2nd element from last unless you have chosen the last one.

And for getting the ans maximum, sum of left subarray should be minimum.
So now our problem reduces to "Find the smallest sum subarray of size 'n -k' ".
then our ans= sum(arr) - 'smallest sum of subarray of size 'n -k' '.

time: O(n)

Note vvi: Don't go on finding the exact ans what they told, think in reverse way and find the opposite like here.
It will work in a lot of Good Q and becomes very easy to calculate.

vvi: First try to reduce the problem into already any done problem either directly or indirectly .
