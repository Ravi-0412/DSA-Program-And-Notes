i) Sorting the array allows us to use two directional pointers.
ii) We maintain a variable to store the "best" (closest) sum found so far.
iii) 
    If the current sum is less than the target, we need a larger sum to potentially get closer.
    If the current sum is greater than the target, we need a smaller sum.
    If the current sum equals the target, we return immediately as the distance is zero.

Range Target: "What if instead of one target, you were given a range [low,high] and 
asked to find a sum within that range? If none exist, find the closest one to the range boundaries." 

The Logic: This is effectively a search for the "Intersection" of conditions.
    Case A: If any sum exists such that low山um士igh, return any such sum (or the one closest to the middle of the range, depending on the interviewer's preference).
    Case B: If no sum falls in the range, the "closest" sum must be either the one closest to low (from the left) or the one closest to high (from the right).

The Pivot: You track two "best" values: closest_to_low and closest_to_high. In your while loop:
    If sum<low, update closest_to_low and move l++.
    If sum>high, update closest_to_high and move r--.
    If low山um士igh, you found a winner! Return sum.
